            <h2>1. Intellectual Property & Usage Restrictions</h2>
            <p>You may not copy, modify, distribute, or use any assets, services, or materials from ReVive/Luxor or any past servers that we have owned or operated.</p>
            <p>Any form of "skidding" (unauthorized copying, reselling, or using materials without permission) is strictly prohibited.</p>
            <p>Unauthorized access, data mining, reverse engineering, or any form of tampering with ReVive/Luxorâ€™s services or infrastructure is forbidden.</p>
            <p>Violating this policy will result in an immediate ban, permanent blacklisting from our services, and revocation of ownership.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>2. Ownership Revocation & Non-Refund Policy</h2>

            <p>If ownership is revoked due to policy violations, including but not limited to theft of assets, developer work, or intellectual property infringement, no refunds will be issued.</p>
            <p>ReVive/Luxor retains all rights to its servers, code, assets, and services, regardless of any transactions made.</p>
            <p>Attempting to dispute ownership revocation through external means (e.g., chargebacks, disputes, or legal claims) will be met with an immediate ban and loss of all services.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Account & Service Termination</h2>
            <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to ReVive/Luxor at any time for violations of this TOS or any misconduct that affects our team, developers, or community.</p>
            <p>Any attempt to bypass bans, exploit services, engage in hacking, leaking files, or using third-party programs to gain an unfair advantage will result in a permanent and irrevocable ban.</p>
            <p>Engaging in harassment, threats, or any form of malicious behavior against ReVive/Luxor staff, developers, or community members will result in an immediate ban and removal from all services.</p>
            <p>Any accounts found to be associated with fraudulent activity, illegal behavior, or terms violations will be permanently disabled.</p>

            <p>We are not responsible for any data loss, service outages, or issues arising from third-party actions, including but not limited to cyberattacks, server downtimes, or force majeure events.</p>
            <p>Users agree to indemnify and hold harmless ReVive/Luxor, its owners, developers, and affiliates from any claims, liabilities, damages, or disputes arising from violations of these terms.</p>
